## Welcome to Project Noodles - Software Developer Track

You're joining a production Financial Intelligence Platform serving real-time market data to thousands of users. Your mission: build and ship features that users will interact with daily—from search functionality to real-time watchlists backed by a full-stack architecture.

### What You're Building

A complete full-stack feature across modern web technologies:
- **Frontend** (Next.js/React) - Responsive UI with optimistic updates
- **API Layer** (Next.js API Routes) - Validated, error-handled endpoints
- **Microservice** (C#/.NET) - RESTful API with health checks
- **Databases** (SQL Server + MongoDB) - Dual persistence for different use cases
- **Deployment** (Docker) - Containerized, production-ready service

This isn't a tutorial—it's production code that will handle real user traffic.

### Your Role

As **Software Developer**, you own features end-to-end. You'll make technical decisions, write production code, and ship features that work reliably at scale. You're not following a template—you're solving real engineering challenges.

**Your Responsibilities:**
- Build responsive React components with proper state management
- Create validated API endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- Develop a C#/.NET microservice with database integration
- Implement optimistic UI updates for instant user feedback
- Write idempotent database operations (no duplicates, no data loss)
- Containerize services with Docker
- Document APIs and deployment procedures

### The Application

**Noodles** is a financial intelligence platform that helps users track and analyze currencies, commodities, and market trends. Users can:
- Browse and search thousands of currencies
- View detailed metrics and charts
- Add currencies to personal watchlists
- Track holdings and portfolio value
- Manage profile and settings

**Your Focus:** The Watchlist feature—a complete user journey from browsing currencies to managing a personal portfolio.

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - UI library with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **React Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

**Backend:**
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions
- **C#/.NET 8** - Microservice framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for SQL Server
- **MongoDB Driver** - Document database client

**Infrastructure:**
- **SQL Server** - Relational data (holdings, transactions)
- **MongoDB** - Activity logs and analytics
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Polly** - Resilience and retry policies

**Skills You'll Master:**
- React component architecture and state management
- API design (validation, error handling, documentation)
- C#/.NET Web API development
- Entity Framework Core (queries, migrations, relationships)
- Database design (SQL schema, indexes, constraints)
- Optimistic UI patterns (instant feedback, error rollback)
- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Health checks and observability

### Your 8-Week Journey

**Weeks 1-2: Frontend Foundation**
- Add loading/empty states to UI components
- Implement search with debouncing
- Build sortable table columns
- Harden API routes with validation

**Weeks 3-4: Backend Integration**
- Scaffold C#/.NET microservice
- Implement SQL Server logging
- Build watchlist CRUD endpoints
- Integrate MongoDB activity tracking

**Weeks 5-6: Advanced Features**
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add error rollback logic
- Ensure idempotent operations
- Validate E2E data flow

**Weeks 7-8: Production Readiness**
- Add health check endpoints
- Implement retry policies with Polly
- Containerize with Docker
- Write deployment documentation

### Key Deliverables

**Week 2:** Enhanced UI with search, sorting, and validated APIs  
**Week 4:** Working .NET microservice with SQL/MongoDB integration  
**Week 6:** Optimistic UI with E2E watchlist feature  
**Week 8:** Dockerized service with health checks and documentation

### Success Criteria

Your code will be evaluated on:
- **Functionality** - Features work reliably under normal and error conditions
- **Code Quality** - Clean, readable, maintainable code with proper patterns
- **Performance** - Fast response times, efficient queries, optimized renders
- **Robustness** - Proper error handling, validation, and edge case coverage
- **Documentation** - Clear API docs, runbooks, and troubleshooting guides

### What Makes This Different

This isn't a toy project. You're building production features with:
- **Real user interactions** (Search, sort, add to watchlist)
- **Real data persistence** (SQL Server + MongoDB)
- **Real error scenarios** (Network failures, invalid input, concurrent updates)
- **Real performance constraints** (Sub-second response times)
- **Real deployment** (Docker containers, health checks)

### Portfolio Impact

By completion, you'll have:
- **Production-ready full-stack feature** with real user value
- **Next.js application** demonstrating modern React patterns
- **C#/.NET microservice** showing backend expertise
- **Database integration** across SQL Server and MongoDB
- **Docker deployment** proving DevOps capabilities
- **Complete documentation** demonstrating professionalism
- **Clean Git history** showing iterative development

**This is portfolio material that gets you hired.**

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Run the Next.js app: `npm run dev`
3. Explore the stablecoins page and detail views
4. Start with Task 1: Onboarding & UI Polish
5. Build iteratively, test thoroughly, document everything

**Let's ship something users will love.** 🚀
