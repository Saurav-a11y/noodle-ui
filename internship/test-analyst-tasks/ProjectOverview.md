## Welcome to Project Noodles - Test Analyst Track

You're joining a production Financial Intelligence Platform where quality isn't optional—it's critical. Your mission: ensure every feature works flawlessly across browsers, devices, and edge cases before it reaches users.

### What You're Validating

A complete financial intelligence platform with complex interactions:
- **Web Application** - Multi-page React app with real-time data
- **API Layer** - RESTful endpoints handling thousands of requests
- **Microservices** - C#/.NET services with database persistence
- **Databases** - SQL Server and MongoDB with complex data flows
- **User Workflows** - Search, filtering, charting, watchlist management

This isn't practice testing—you're the last line of defense before production.

### Your Role

As **Test Analyst**, you own quality across the entire stack. You'll design test strategies, execute comprehensive test suites, automate regression tests, and validate data integrity from UI to database. You're not just finding bugs—you're ensuring reliability.

**Your Responsibilities:**
- Design comprehensive test strategies for features
- Write BDD scenarios in Gherkin format
- Execute manual tests with detailed evidence
- Build automated test suites with Playwright
- Create API test collections with Postman
- Validate database integrity (SQL Server + MongoDB)
- Perform security testing (XSS, injection, validation)
- Test performance, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility
- Document findings with reproduction steps and evidence

### The Application

**Noodles** processes real-time financial data and presents it through interactive dashboards. Users depend on accurate data and reliable functionality. Your testing ensures:
- Search returns correct results instantly
- Charts display accurate market data
- Watchlists persist across sessions
- Profile updates save correctly
- APIs handle errors gracefully
- Database operations are idempotent

**One bug in production could mean incorrect financial data. Your testing prevents that.**

### Technology Stack

**Testing Tools:**
- **Selenium WebDriver (C#)** - UI automation with Page Object Model
- **Postman/Newman** - API testing and automation
- **Docker** - Consistent test environments
- **SQL Server Management Studio** - Database validation
- **MongoDB Compass** - Document database verification
- **Browser DevTools** - Performance and network analysis

**Testing Types:**
- **Manual Testing** - Exploratory, edge cases, usability
- **BDD Testing** - Gherkin scenarios (Given-When-Then)
- **API Testing** - Request/response validation, error handling
- **Automation** - Regression suites, smoke tests
- **Database Testing** - Data integrity, idempotency
- **Performance Testing** - Load times, response times
- **Security Testing** - XSS, injection, validation
- **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG 2.1 compliance

**Skills You'll Master:**
- Test strategy and planning
- BDD scenario writing (Gherkin)
- Postman test scripting (JavaScript)
- Selenium automation (C#)
- Page Object Model pattern
- SQL query validation
- MongoDB query validation
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security vulnerability testing
- Professional test documentation

### Your 8-Week Journey

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up Docker test environment
- Execute smoke tests across critical pages
- Write BDD scenarios for search and filters
- Build initial Postman collection

**Weeks 3-4: Deep Validation**
- Test currency detail page components
- Validate chart interactions and data accuracy
- Test user profile with security focus
- Expand Postman collection to 50+ tests

**Weeks 5-6: Full Stack Testing**
- Validate E2E watchlist flow (UI → API → Database)
- Query SQL Server for data verification
- Query MongoDB for activity logs
- Test idempotency and error scenarios

**Weeks 7-8: Automation & Integration**
- Build Selenium C# test suite (15+ tests)
- Implement Page Object Model
- Run cross-browser tests
- Perform performance and security testing
- Create professional test portfolio

### Key Deliverables

**Week 2:** BDD scenarios + Postman collection + baseline evidence  
**Week 4:** Comprehensive manual tests + security validation  
**Week 6:** E2E tests with database validation + evidence pack  
**Week 8:** Selenium C# automated test suite + final portfolio + presentation

### Success Criteria

Your testing will be evaluated on:
- **Coverage** - All critical paths and edge cases tested
- **Evidence Quality** - Clear screenshots, queries, reproduction steps
- **Automation** - Reliable, maintainable test scripts
- **Documentation** - Professional reports with metrics and insights
- **Collaboration** - Effective communication with developers and data analysts

### What Makes This Different

This isn't checkbox testing. You're ensuring production quality with:
- **Real user workflows** (Search → View → Add to watchlist)
- **Real data validation** (SQL Server + MongoDB queries)
- **Real error scenarios** (Network failures, invalid input, concurrent updates)
- **Real performance requirements** (Pages load in <3 seconds)
- **Real security risks** (XSS, injection, data exposure)

### Portfolio Impact

By completion, you'll have:
- **Professional test portfolio** showcasing comprehensive QA skills
- **BDD scenarios** (20+ in Gherkin format)
- **Postman collection** (50+ API tests with automation)
- **Selenium C# suite** (15+ automated tests with POM)
- **Database validation** (SQL Server + MongoDB queries)
- **Test reports** with metrics, findings, and recommendations
- **Evidence pack** (screenshots, videos, query results)
- **Security findings** demonstrating vulnerability testing

**This is portfolio material that gets you hired.**

### Getting Started

1. Read the Docker setup guide: `docker-setup.md`
2. Set up your environment (Docker, Postman, SQL client, MongoDB Compass)
3. Review the application (browse stablecoins, view details, check profile)
4. Start with Task 1: Setup, Smoke Test & Baseline
5. Test systematically, document thoroughly, automate strategically

**Let's ensure flawless quality.** 🚀
