## Task 6 – Power BI: One Clean Dashboard (+ optional RLS)

### What you will do
Build a clear dashboard from SQL/SSAS with trends and comparisons.

### Steps
1. Create PBIX in `bi-artifacts/powerbi/`
2. Connect to SQL (Import or DirectQuery) or SSAS
3. Add visuals: price trend, top gainers, most talked, simple correlation
4. Add slicers (date, symbol/category)
5. Optional: add basic RLS and note how to test it

### Deliverables
- PBIX file
- Screenshots of visuals and interactions
- Notes on Import vs DirectQuery choice and any RLS rules

### Done when
- PBIX opens, visuals work, interactions are smooth on sample data; RLS (if added) is documented.
