## Task 8 – Reconcile with App + Final Demo (Milestone 2)

### What you will do
Compare your BI numbers with the app, explain any differences, and package a demo.

### Steps
1. Pick 2–3 metrics (e.g., Top Gainers, Most Talked, a price trend)
2. Compare BI vs app (note the endpoint from `apis/index.ts`)
3. If numbers differ, explain why (timing, filters, definitions)
4. Create a short demo script and final README
5. Zip reports (SSRS), PBIX, model export, scripts, and screenshots

### Deliverables
- Reconciliation report (with causes/fixes for any differences)
- Demo script + final README
- Zipped evidence pack (reports, PBIX, model export, scripts, screenshots)

### Done when
- Differences (if any) are explained; demo is clear; Milestone 2 completed.
