## Task 4 – SSAS Tabular: Model + Measures (Milestone 1)

### What you will do
Build a small Tabular model on your star schema and add a few DAX measures.

### Steps
1. Create SSAS Tabular model in `bi-artifacts/ssas/`
2. Add relationships matching your ERD
3. Add measures: price change, volatility, engagement counts
4. Process the model (small sample) and take screenshots

### Deliverables
- SSAS model export (Model.bim / JSON)
- List of DAX measures and relationship diagram
- Processing screenshots and brief notes

### Done when
- Model processes, measures return values, and relationships look correct. Milestone 1 ready.
